The main aims is to help the graduate students to get to grips with the basic ideas of computer programming and, more specifically, the use of Matlab. At the same time, the exercises draw on material / requirements from other modules on the course and give us the opportunity for hands-on revision of some important concepts (time series data, linear/non-linear regression, etc.).  The syllabus is for a 10 week (10 x 2h) lab class, assuming very little computer experience (or maths) at the start.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the code. I accept donations in the form of freshly roasted coffee beans.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the course was designed by us (Dan Shub, now at Walter Read, www.wrnmmc.capmed.mil; and Denis Schluppeck) to have 3 chunks.\r\n\r\n1. an introduction to the basic ideas (variables, functions, control flow) - running over **the first 2 weeks**. Check out the material in the **aToZ-intro** folder and the associated [readme file here.](aToZ-intro)\r\n2. a hands-on group project, designing and programming up a simple, but working, behavioural experiment, **4 weeks**. A brief overview of this part of the course is in the [in the behaviour section.](behaviour-01)\r\n3. a second project, building some basic utilities / functions for looking at neuroimaging data and performing linear regression (GLM), **4 weeks**. Details on the imaging-related unitsis outlined in [here.](imaging-01)\r\n\r\n## Possible timetable\r\n\r\n| Week  | Unit  | Topic        |\r\n| ----- | ------------- | ----|  \r\n| 1     | [aToZ-intro](aToZ-intro) |  What is Matlab, the environment, variables, indexing, ...  |\r\n| 2     | [aToZ-intro](aToZ-intro)  |  Logical variables, indexing, looping, branching, functions, ... |\r\n| 3     |  [behaviour-01](behaviour-01) | Overview: building a simple psychophysical experiment; info from experimenter & subject  |\r\n| 4     | [behaviour-02](behaviour-02) | Making a stimulus and putting it up on the screen  |\r\n| 5     | [behaviour-03](behaviour-03) | Getting responses from the subject & fine-tuning   |\r\n| 6     | [behaviour-04](behaviour-04) | Analyzing the behavioural data, fitting and plotting  |\r\n| 7     | [imaging-01](imaging-01)  | Building / fixing up a simple image viewer |\r\n| 8     | [imaging-02](imaging-02)  | A function that constructs a simple design matrix  |\r\n| 9     | [imaging-03](imaging-03)  | Hands-on linear regression (using a sample timecourse)  |\r\n| 10     | [imaging-04](imaging-04)  | Doing regression *stats*, displaying, ... Close  |\r\n\r\n## How to get these materials\r\n\r\nAssuming you are on a Mac: open up a ``Terminal`` (double-click /Applications/Utilities/Terminal). Then do the following:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# if you don't already have one: create a ``matlab`` directory in your home space (``~``), then change directory to it:\r\ncd ~\r\nmkdir matlab\r\ncd matlab  \r\n# get MGL\r\ngit clone https://github.com/justingardner/mgl.git\r\n# get these tutorials\r\ngit clone https://github.com/schluppeck/c84nim.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need to add both these subfolders to your path; then you should be good to go:\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\naddpath(genpath('~/matlab/'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Grabbing updates\r\n\r\nTo make sure you have any updates to this material, open a Termina, change directory to the ``c84nim`` folder and issue ``git pull`` . This will sync you the material on github.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- In the 2015/2016 iteration of the course, I have modified the hands-on project for building a simple behavioural task to use **mgl** (https://github.com/justingardner/mgl). Although this requires teaching a couple more details on how stimuli are being displayed by the OpenGL machinery and it's not pure Matlab, it's (a) more realistic and (b) makes displaying different kinds of stimuli, obtaining keyboard responses, etc. much more fun and doable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\ndenis.schluppeck@nottingham.ac.uk\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
