The main aims is to help the graduate students to get to grips with the basic ideas of computer programming and, more specifically, the use of Matlab. At the same time, the exercises draw on material / requirements from other modules on the course and give us the opportunity for hands-on revision of some important concepts (time series data, linear/non-linear regression, etc.).  The syllabus is for a 10 week (10 x 2h) lab class, assuming very little computer experience (or maths) at the start.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use the code. I accept donations in the form of freshly roasted coffee beans.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the course was designed by us (Dan Shub, now at Walter Read, www.wrnmmc.capmed.mil; and Denis Schluppeck) to have 3 chunks.\r\n\r\n1. an introduction to the basic ideas (variables, functions, control flow) - running over **the first 2 weeks**. \r\n2. a hands-on group project, designing and programming up a simple, but working, behavioural experiment, **4 weeks**. \r\n3. a second project, building some basic utilities / functions for looking at neuroimaging data and performing linear regression (GLM), **4 weeks**. \r\n\r\nLook at the [course repository page](http://github.com/schluppeck/c84nim) for up-to-date materials.\r\n\r\n**Enjoy!**\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\ndenis.schluppeck@nottingham.ac.uk\r\n","google":"UA-4276724-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
