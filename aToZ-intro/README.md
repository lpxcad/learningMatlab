# Introduction & Overview

In the first two units, we'll be going over some Matlab basics:
- how to start up the Matlab interpreter, + integrated development environment (IDE)
- some *syntax*, simple commands
- generally getting comfortable with the idea of turning your ideas into code


## Materials

You can refer to a short [matlab primer](c84nim-exercises.pdf) that will walk you through some of the basics.

## Exercises

To make sure you are ready for the mini-projects (1) on building a simple *behavioural* experiment and (2) related to the neuroimaging analysis, I suggest you walk through the following 3 sets of exercises on the Matlab command prompt. **It's important that you _think_ about what should be happening before you hit the return key to execute the code**. You could even put all the lines into a file in the Matlab editor window and write comments to go along:

1. [Doing basic maths on the command prompt](01-firstSteps.md)
2. [Simple commands](02-simpleCommands.md) for getting the mean, std, etc.
3. [More simple commands](03-moreSimpleCommands.md) and some practice making vectors and matrices that contain specific things.
